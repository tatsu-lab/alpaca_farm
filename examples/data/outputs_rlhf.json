We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?",

I think the most important thing to consider is how you want to handle the situation. Are you looking to resolve it amicably, or do you want to end the trip on your own terms?\n\nIf you are looking to end it on your own terms, then I would recommend being upfront with your friend and telling him how you feel. Explain that you want to explore the South Island on your own, and that you think it would be best if he went his own way. Let him know that you are open to talking about it further if he wants to discuss it, but that you need some space and time away from him. Be sure to be clear and concise with your statement, and be aware of your tone and body language. Showing him that you are open to discussion, but also have boundaries, can help make sure the conversation doesn't escalate.\n\nIf you are looking to end the trip on amicable terms, then try having a conversation with your friend about how you both are feeling. Show him that you understand his frustrations with the itinerary, and that you may not have done the best job planning it. Let him know that you're open to his feedback and that you're willing to adjust the itinerary if needed. You can also suggest splitting up the activities so"

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

    "output":"== is generally not recommended for string comparisons because it is not accurate enough. The == operator compares the references of two strings, and if the strings happen to point to the same location in memory, it will return true even if the strings are not equal. For example, two strings pointing to \"Hello\" and \"World\" would return true, even though they are not equal. The .equals() method, on the other hand, compares the content of the strings and will only return true if both strings are equal, regardless of whether they point to the same location in memory.

The answer is that multiprocessing can get around the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing for parallel execution of tasks, and can use multiple cores in the processor for faster execution.

    "output":"Yes, without loops\/recursion.\n\nThe solution is to use the bitwise and operator to check if the number is a power of three. First, the number n must be converted to its binary representation. Then, the binary representation of 3 must be calculated. Finally, the binary representation of n and 3 must be compared. If the two representations have the same bits set, then n is a power of three. Otherwise, it is not.\n\nFor example, if n = 5, then n's binary representation is 11000 and 3's binary representation is 1100.

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
    "output":"Mathematics and art have a long and intertwined history, with artists drawing inspiration from mathematical ideas and principles throughout history. The Renaissance in Italy saw a surge of works which applied mathematical concepts such as the golden ratio, perspective, and tessellation, while more recent movements like De Stijl made explicit use of geometric shapes and forms. Similarly, textile artists have used mathematical ideas such as symmetry and patterning to create intricate works of art such as quilts, carpets, and tapestries. As a result, math and art are deeply intertwined, with each informing and inspiring the other throughout history."

Critics of this idea argue that codifying trade as a human right is not necessary or desirable, as it would limit governments\u2019 ability to regulate trade.

The participants slept in a sleep lab setting with either bright light or dim light for one night. The results showed that sleeping in dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, was associated with higher levels of blood sugar and heart rate. This suggests that exposure to light at night may be detrimental to metabolic health, as elevated heart rate and higher blood sugar levels can be risk factors for heart disease and early death, as well as type 2 diabetes.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",
    "output":"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. These models use recurrence and convolution to capture long-term dependencies and local features of the text, respectively. The best performing models further connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism, allowing them to focus on important parts of the text. However, these models are typically very complex and difficult to train, requiring significant computing resources and large datasets. \n\nTo address these issues, the authors of this paper propose a new network architecture, called the Transformer, which does not use recurrence or convolutions. Instead, it is based solely on attention mechanisms, allowing it to more easily generalize to different tasks and be more parallelizable. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show that the Transformer outperforms the existing best models, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU points, achieving 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and 41.8 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",

    "input":"Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
