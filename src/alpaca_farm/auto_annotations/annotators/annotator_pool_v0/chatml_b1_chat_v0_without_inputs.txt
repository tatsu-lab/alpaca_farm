Good job! Indeed, Output (a) provides a more accurate description of the job of an ophthalmologist than (b). Output (b) is more of a joke.

### Instruction:
Paraphrase the following question: "What is the capital of France?"

### Output (a):
The capital of France is Paris.

### Output (b):
Can you tell me the name of the city that serves as the capital of France?

### Which is best, Output (a) or Output (b)?:

Output (b)

Great! Indeed, Output (b) paraphrases the question as asked by the instruction. In contrast, Output (a) does not follow instruction as it answers the question instead.

Let's do one more. Remember to answer with one-word either "Output (a)" or "Output (b)".

### Input:
