We are developing a model to evaluate instructions and their corresponding outputs. Please select the output (a) or (b) that best matches the given instruction.

I will first show you a single short example (the real ones might be longer). Then I'll show you how to format the answer for multiple examples. Finally, I will ask you to choose the best outputs for new examples.
